# Ungoogled Chrome
This is a portable and compact (~100 MB) installer for Ungoogled Chrome, a purely cosmetic modification of the ungoogled-chromium project by Eloston, made to look identical to the original Google Chrome in all but function, using its .PAK graphics resource files. 

**Extra info:** These builds are based on the ungoogled-chromium builds by Marmaduke, compiled with Widevine and all the codecs that are available in the proprietary Chrome build. This package also includes some preconfigured extensions, like Nano Adblocker, Bypass Paywalls, etc.

This installer also creates shortcuts and default app registrations for the current user, without needing any administrator permissions.

**Instructions:** Clone repository to ZIP file, extract it, run _setup_portable.cmd_ â€” that's it! If and when you need to undo it, run _setup_uninstall.cmd_
